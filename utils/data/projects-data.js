        description: "Me and my team built a MERN-based BookTrade platform where users can buy, sell, donate, and borrow second-hand books.

The platform supports book listings with images, wishlist, cart, and order management. Integrated Google Books API for fetching book metadata. Implemented category-wise and class-wise routing for book collections. Added real-time features like book request notifications and chat (optional). The system includes complete CRUD operations, user profiles, and book management dashboards.",
